# Adamant.Tools.Compiler.Bootstrap.Semantics.SyntaxSymbols

The syntax symbols provide a symbol tree over the syntax tree. They allow lookup of the syntax nodes using names like symbols provide lookup of the semantic tree using names. They are a primilnary version of the symbols.

The interfaces are used as a readonly version of the tree by the rest of the semantic analysis phase while the classes are used as mutable versions during the building phase.
