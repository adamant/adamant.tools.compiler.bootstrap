# Adamant.Tools.Compiler.Bootstrap.Types

Types name the possible types in a program. Many types correspond directly to some name in the program. However, other types are constructed out of those types. For example, by substituting in type arguments. Types may be either *open* or *closed*. An open type is one which has at least one unspecific type parameter. A closed type has all of its type parameters fully specified.
