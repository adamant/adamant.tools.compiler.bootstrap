## Naming Notes

* Use `Code` instead of `Source`: The word "source" is often ambigious. When combined with other words it is unclear whether it means the source code or simply the source of some data. Additionally, dictionaries do not give "source code" as one of the definitions of "source". The phrase "source code" is a little long, however, the word "code" does have a definition as computer code or source code.
