# Adamant Bootstrap Compiler

A bootstrap compiler for the [Adamant language](http://adamant-lang.org).  That is, a compiler for a subset of the language that will be used to write the Adamant compiler in Adamant. The compiler currently compiles a small subset of the Adamant language to C.

## Project Status: Alpha Active

The compiler is under active development. It is in a very early stage, and there are likely issues and limitations. APIs are subject to frequent breaking changes.
