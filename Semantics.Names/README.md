# Adamant.Tools.Compiler.Bootstrap.Semantics.Names

Names are used as keys to reference semantic nodes. The symbol tree is what allows a node to be looked up by name. As such, names are always fully qualified and the kind of object they refer to is known. There are unqualified, qualified, fully qualified and package qualified names in the syntax of Adamant. These name objects do not represent those.
